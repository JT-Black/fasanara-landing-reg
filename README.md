# Fasanara Capital Landing Page
This is a landing page I made for Fasanara Capital, a London-based Fintech company. 

### Deployed App:
[Fasanara Capital](https://jt-black.github.io/fasanara-landing-reg/)

### Tech Stack:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### The Brief:
I was asked to build a landing page. That was all I had to go on. 
I had never built one before so I googled to find out best landing-page practices. 
I took a look at the company's website to get a feeling for what they were looking for.

### Building:
After reading a bit on landing pages, I decided to make an un-cluttered, simple page that directed the user to the signup button. 
I decided to build a top part of 100vh, and a bottom part of 100vh that would be scrolled to.

#### The top part needed:
- headline
- a call to action
- social proof
- visuals

#### Below the fold needed:
- features
- social proof
- call to action
- link to main site
